  abstract  = {One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science. This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.}

  abstract      = {If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom, there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

  abstract   = {A finite state model for the specification and validation of communication protocols is considered. The concept of ``direct coupling'' between interactiing finite state components is used to describe a hierarchical structure of protocol layers. The paper discusses different aspects of protocol validation, some verification tools based on the finite state formalism, and the basic limitations of the finite state modelling of protocols. An ``empty medium abstraction'' is proposed for reducing the complexity of the overall system description. The concept of ``adjoint states'' can be useful for summarizing the relative synchronization between the communicating system components. These concepts are applied to the analysis of a simple alternating bit protocol, and to the X.25 call set-up and clearing procedures. The analysis of X.25 shows that the procedures are stable in respect to intermittant perturbations in the synchronization of the interface introduced for different reasons, including occasional packet loss. However, on very rare occasions, an undesirable cyclic behaviour could be encountered.},

It has been created with the simulation of communication networks, multiprocessors and other distributed systems in mind as application area, but instead of building a specialized simulator, OMNeT++ was designed to be as general as possible. Since then, the idea has proven to work, and OMNeT++ has been used in numerous domains from queuing network simulations to wireless and ad-hoc network simulations, from business process simulation to peer-to-peer network, optical switch and storage area network simulations. This paper presents an overview of the OMNeT++ framework, recent challenges brought about by the growing amount and complexity of third party simulation models, and the solutions we introduce in the next major revision of the simulation framework.},

  abstract  = {High quality time-bin entanglement is widely exploited to achieve the purposes of fundamental tests of physics and the implementation of quantum communication protocols both in free space and optical fiber propagation. However, the imperfect approaches of generating time-bin entangled state will degrade its quality and limit its practical application. Entanglement purification is to distill high quality entangled states from low quality entangled states. In this paper, we present the first entanglement purification protocol (EPP) for time-bin entanglement. We first explain this EPP for two-photon time-bin entangled state and then extend it to the system of multi-photon time-bin entangled state. We also design a possible realization of this EPP with practical spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) source. Differ from the conventional EPPs, this EPP does not require the sophisticated controlled-not (CNOT) gate or similar operations, and it uses the feasible sum-frequency generation (SFG) to perform the purification. Moreover, the double-pair noise emitted from the SPDC source can be eliminated automatically which is the other advantage of this EPP. If we combine with the faithful entanglement swapping, this EPP may have potential to be a part of full quantum repeaters.}
