 Quantum networking is the new paradigm of networking that allows to transfer quantum state and achieve various new applications.  RuleSet-based communication protocol is known to be one of the practical communication protocols to establish a scalable quantum network.
 Ideally, multiplexing and real-time resource management should be realized in order to improve the performance and robustness of the network. However, the protocol to handle multiple connections and allocate of physical links has not been proposed.
 This thesis proposes the link management protocol for quantum network that involves negotiation to determine a set of RuleSets (which is called a link allocation policy) to execute and the timing of apply the new link allocation policy.
 It also discusses the implementation of communication setup and teardown based on the proposed protocol and validates the proposed approach by performing a set of network simulations.
