\section{Conclusion}

This thesis proposed the link management protocol for quantum network, which provides coordinated decision about two aspects.
One is the upcoming link allocation policy, which are the list of RuleSets, or operations each node needs to execute in order to establish an end-to-end connection.
The other one is the particular Bell pair that the next link allocation policy should be applied to.
Also, the author validated the approach by performing several simulation for a RuleSet-based quantum network.
