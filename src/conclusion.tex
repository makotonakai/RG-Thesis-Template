\section{Conclusion}

This thesis proposed the link management protocol for quantum network, which provides coordinated decision about two aspects.
One is the upcoming link allocation policy, which are the list of RuleSets, or operations each node needs to execute in order to establish an end-to-end connection.
The other one is the particular Bell pair that the next link allocation policy should be applied to.
Also, the author validated the approach by performing several simulation for a RuleSet-based quantum network.

\section{Future work}

The quantum network requires more advanced multiplexing methods, such as a prioritized multiplexing, in order to enhance the overall performance of the entire network.
It is also desirable to develop congestion control techniques for a quantum network to figure out the better use of resources and void congestion control on the overall network.
