\chapter{Proposal: Link Management For Quantum Network}
\label{proposal}

\section{Overview}

This chapter proposes the protocol for the management of the physical bell pairs that are available on each quantum link.

This protocol has two separated phases. The first phase is the negotiation about the set of RuleSets that are going to be established in the next round. The second phase is the negotiation about when to apply the next set of RuleSets.
These negotiations will take place between the two end point of each link.

\section{Assumptions}

This protocol is proposed based on the following assumptions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Existence of both a classical link and quantum link between two neighboring nodes.
  \item No delay in transmitting messages 
  \item No failures in nodes and links
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}

This protocol has several requirements as follows.

\subsubsection{Functional requirements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Coordinate what set of RuleSets and their order to execute in the next round
  \item Coordinate the timing of when to execute these RuleSets
  \item Perform these negotiations between the two end nodes of each link.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non functional requirements}
