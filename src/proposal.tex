\chapter{Proposal: Link Management For Quantum Network}
\label{proposal}

\section{Overview}

This chapter proposes the protocol for the management of the physical bell pairs that are available on each quantum link.

This protocol has two separated phases. The first phase is the negotiation about the set of RuleSets that are going to be established in the next round. The second phase is the negotiation about when to apply the next set of RuleSets.
These negotiations will take place between the two end point of each link.
