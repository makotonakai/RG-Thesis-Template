First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to professor Rodney Van Meter, who has supervised my research activities in the last six years in AQUA.
I would also like to show my gratitude Dr.Takahiko Satoh, who is now an associate professor at the School of Science and Engineering at Keio University, for his patient to nurture my ability in terms of all the aspects of my research, such as problem definition, proposal, implementation and presentation.
Next, I would like to appreciate Dr.Michal Hajdu≈°ek for guiding me to the world of quantum nonlinear physics and offering me an opportunity of simulating quantum synchronization, which is an intriguing phenomena which can be observed in open quantum system.
Almost, I feel grateful Dr.Shota Nagayama for supervising both my presentation and thesis almost every night, even at 1:00 a.m. If my thesis deserves my Master's degree, I would not have written this without his huge support.
Furthermore, I would like to thank Kentaro Teramoto, who has patiently taught me how to use QuISP and helped me with debugging every time I became stuck.
I would like to thank all the faculties members and all the students I have met in the Nakamura lab.

Furthermore, I'm extremely grateful to Nobufumi Fukumoto, who is my private mentor and has supervised my activities as a software developer for the last six years. I became interested in the field of infrastructure, especially network architecture, after I heard so many interesting episodes when he was designing large-scale enterprise networks.
I would not have chosen to work on quantum networking for the research topic for my Master's thesis, and even pursue my career as a site reliability engineer if I have not met him six years ago. 

Lastly but not least, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to all of my family members, including my cats Maru and Uni, who have supported me for the last twenty five years.
