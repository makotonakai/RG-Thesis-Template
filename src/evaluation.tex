\section{Experiment}

The author performed several experiments using QuISP (Quantum Internet Simulation Package) and demonstration of the proposed protocol in several circumstances.

\subsection{Two Node Network With an MM Link}
Both nodes coordinated both the upcoming link allocation policy and the sequence number of the first available physical entanglement pair.

\subsection{Two Node Network With an MIM Link}
Both nodes coordinated both the upcoming link allocation policy and the sequence number of the first available physical entanglement pair.
