Fig \ref{fig:result1} shows the number of link-level Bell pairs that are allocated to each RuleSet.
This figure shows that several RuleSets are already stored before the the generation of link-level Bell pairs is notified, and link-level Bell pairs are allocated to those RuleSet once the generation starts, which is a clear sign of multiplexing on a RuleSet-based quantum network.
It also shows that the number of allocated link-level Bell pairs declines.  This clearly indicates that link-level Bell pairs that are allocated but not consumed by each RuleSet were released after the relevant connection is torn down.

\subsubsection{Setting}
Table \ref{table:parameter-for-experiment2} is the table of parameters that are used in this experiment.

Each RuleSet in this experiment requires twice as many link-level Bell pairs as how many Bell pairs generated in each round.
Fig \ref{fig:result2} shows that it takes more than one thousands events to finish multiplexing, which is more than twice as many events as how many it took in the previous experiment.

\subsubsection{Setting}
Table \ref{table:parameter-for-experiment3} is the table of parameters that are used in this experiment.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Result}
% 100 bell pairs, but 200 buffers
\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{The figure of the number of link-level Bell pairs allocated to each RuleSet}

\end{figure}

The number of link-level Bell pairs generated in each round is twice as many as how many it is required by each RuleSet.
In the two previous experiments, one hundred link-level Bell pairs are generated in each round and more than one hundred link-level Bell pairs are allocated to a single RuleSet, which means that it takes more than one round of the generation of link-level Bell pairs until the execution of each RuleSet is terminated.
However, this experiment takes only one round of the generation of link-level Bell pairs until a single RuleSet is successfully executed.  This means that it is more time-efficient if the number of link-level Bell pairs generated in each round exceeds that of the total number of those required by a single RuleSet.
